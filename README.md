This repo will allow you to deploy a Saltstack minion that hosts an OpenRCT2 server.

Prerequisites:

- Any (updated) Linux distro, although this repo is based on Ubuntu Xenial
- A fully configured salt master
- The files provided with an original install of RCT2. Both GOG and Steam will do. Files need to be present on the minion.
#TODO automate uploading of rct2 files

#TODO: Fill out the rest
